## About KLBlog

KLBlog is powerd by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com). Some of the ideas are inspired by  [Type on Strap](https://github.com/sylhare/Type-on-Strap).

I'm a beginner of front-end developing, so I tried to write minimal amout of CSS to implement desired appearance. As a result, KLBlog is rather crude. But It still follows the basic rules of responsive design. So it should look good on most devices.
